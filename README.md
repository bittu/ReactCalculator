react calculator using react-native

We recommend installing Node.js and Python2 via Chocolatey, a popular package manager for Windows. Open a Command Prompt as Administrator, then run:

choco install nodejs.install
choco install python2
You can find additional installation options on Node.js's Downloads page.
The React Native CLI 
Node.js comes with npm, which lets you install the React Native command line interface.

Run the following command in a Terminal:

npm install -g react-native-cli

react-native init AwesomeProject
cd AwesomeProject
react-native start

react-native run-android
